        Chrome extension that finds the last(or current) spotify song played and finds the
        lyrics and samples that are found in the song.Made to replace musixmatch
        on spotify.

    <h1> How it works:
                    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Spotify 's API currently does not have a function to get the current song played by a user, so I got around it by scrobbling my play history to last.fm. The last.fm API has the function that Spotify's is missing, so I used it alongside the musixmatch API to search for lyrics and display them.Sample functionality is not yet implemented.

    <br> <h2> To Do: </h2>
    <br> - Add sampling functionality
    <br> - Integrate with genius.com rather than musixmatch (when the former's API is updated for lyric grabbing)
    <br> - Tidy up CSS
    <br>
